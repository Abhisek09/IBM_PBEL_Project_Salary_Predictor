# Salary Prediction using Ensemble Learning

A machine learning app that predicts salaries based on user input or uploaded datasets using regression models.

Live App: https://ibmpbelprojectsalarypredictor.streamlit.app/



## Features


- Predict salary for individual entries via a simple form
- Bulk predictions via CSV upload
- Compare predicted salary with actual salary using MAE, RMSE, and R²
- Uses an ensemble of regression models with XGBoost as the best performer
- Integrated model evaluation for performance testing
- Deployed with Streamlit for an interactive web experience
